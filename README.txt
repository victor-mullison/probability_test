-- Simple C++ Probability Testing Program --
I threw this together to help me understand a famous probability and statistics problem.

Requires a C++ compiler, instructions given for g++
Build instructions:
From the root directory, 
Run: g++ -o output_name probability_test.cpp

To run the built program, 
Run: ./output_name.exe
